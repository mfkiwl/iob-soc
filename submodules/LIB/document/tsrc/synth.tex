A {\tt .tcl} script is provided for the Cadence Genus synthesis tool. The script
reads the technology files, compiles and elaborates the design, and proceeds to
synthesize it. Timing constraints file(s) are provided.

After synthesis, reports on silicon area usage, power consumption, and timing
closure are generated. A post-synthesis Verilog file is created, which can be
used in post-synthesis simulation. The IP core is synthesized without memories,
which are treated as black boxes. RAM blocks are not included as they are
technonoly dependent. The user is free to generate and add the required
memories, or request this service from the IP core provider.
