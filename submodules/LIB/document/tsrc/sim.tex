The provided testbench uses the core instance described in
Section~\ref{sec:inst}. A high-level block diagram of the testbench is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:tbbd}. The testbench is organized in a modular fashion, with
each test described in a separate file. The test suite consists of all the test
case files to make adding, modifying, or removing tests easy.

\subsubsection*{System-level Simulation}

Upon request, simulation files to run the core embedded in a RISC-V system can
be provided. The core is exercised in various modes by the RISC-V processor,
using a bare-metal software program written in the C programming language.
